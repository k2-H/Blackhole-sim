# Blackhole-sim🌌
🌌 Black Hole Light Ray Simulator
A 2D interactive simulation that visualizes how light rays behave near a black hole using simplified gravitational physics. Click anywhere on the screen to emit a photon—it will orbit, spiral inward, and disappear once it crosses the event horizon.

I built this to explore how black holes look, not just how they’re described. The simulation includes a thermal-inspired color gradient to represent rising energy and temperature as light approaches the singularity:

White → Red: Outer region (redshift, lower energy)
Red → Blue: Near the photon sphere (increasing temperature)
Blue → Dark Blue: Just outside the event horizon (extreme gravity)
Light rays that cross the event horizon are removed—just like in reality, nothing escapes.

Newtonian gravity with damping (simplified model for visual intuition)
⚠️ Note: This isn’t a general relativity simulator—it’s a visual metaphor grounded in real concepts, built for curiosity and learning. 

📝 Why I Made This
I’ve always been fascinated by black holes—especially how they warp light and space. Instead of just watching videos or reading articles, I wanted to build something that lets you play with those ideas in real time.

This project started as a weekend experiment and turned into a deeper dive into orbital mechanics, color theory, and how to turn physics into visuals.

Made with curiosity. 

⚠️No photons were harmed (but many were swallowed).
