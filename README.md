# Blackhole-sim
It is a 2d simulation of a blackhole that uses light rays (appearing from the click of your mouse) to show and depict how a actual blackhole appears to be like. I have tried to add color gradient to depict the rise in temperature as we move closer to the event horizon and the when light rays touch the event horizon they disappear.
